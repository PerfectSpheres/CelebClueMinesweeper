                <p> The unexpected death of your estranged eccentric uncle Benoit Blanc threw your life into an
                    whirlwind. You received a letter inviting you to his sprawling estate for the opening of his vault
                    and reading of his will in 7 days, along with all other inheritors. An additional secret message
                    addressed to you the last living male relative, “Everything is not what it seems; I’m close to my
                    completing my magnun opus, but I see dangers all around me. If you are reading finish your uncle's
                    work and avoid falling prey as well.
                </p>
                <p> Arriving at the mansion, you were astounded by the beautiful women surrounding you. You knew that
                    your uncle had always enjoyed the company of busty, gorgeous women, but you hadn’t realized he was
                    able to keep this much of it out of the net. Now, you must find the true killer among them within 7
                    days. The clock is ticking!</p>

                        is the killer.
                    <li> You have 7 days (actions) to find the killer and solve the mystery.
                    </li>
                    <li> Each night, you can seduce one of the ladies by clicking their picture. When you do, you'll
                        find evidence exhonorating two other characters - but never any that you've already seduced.
                    </li>
                    <li> After 7 nights, catch the killer(s): drag as many laddies to Sophie the Cop to make an arrest,
                        then <b>Book'em </b>
                        claim your inheritance.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can turn in as many of your harem members as you like increasing your odds of catching the
                        killer, but then you'll lose out on their share of the inheritance. </li>
