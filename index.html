                <p> The unexpected death of your estranged eccentric uncle Benoit Blanc threw your life into an
                    whirlwind. You received a letter inviting you to his sprawling estate for the opening of his vault
                    and reading of his will in 7 days, along with all other inheritors. An additional secret message
                    addressed to you the last living male relative, “Everything is not what it seems; I’m close to my
                    completing my magnun opus, but I see dangers all around me. If you are reading finish your uncle's
                    work and avoid falling prey as well.
                </p>
                <p> Arriving at the mansion, you were astounded by the beautiful women surrounding you. You knew that
                    your uncle had always enjoyed the company of busty, gorgeous women, but you hadn’t realized he was
                    able to keep this much of it out of the net. Now, you must find the true killer among them within 7
                    days. The clock is ticking!</p>
                <h2>"Rules – for Tits Out"</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> There are 21 suspects, but only one of them is the killer.
                    <li> You have 7 days (or actions) to find the killer and solve the mystery.
                    </li>
                    <li> Each night, you can seduce one of the ladies by selecting their picture. When you do, you'll
                        reveal two other characters as innocent - but never any that you've already seduced.
                    </li>
                    <li> Once you think you've identified the killer, drag them to Sophie the Cop to make an arrest and
                        claim your harem.
                    </li>
                    <li>If you haven't found the killer by the end of the 7 days, beware: they may have seduced you
                        instead! In this case, you'll need to choose which members of your harem to accuse by dragging
                        them to Sophie the Cop. You can select multiple suspects to turn in, but be warned: once your
                        choices are locked in, it's too late to change your mind. Will you correctly identify the
                        killer, or will you become their next victim? </li>
                </ol>
