                    and reading of his will in 7 days, along with all other inheritors. An additional secret message
                    addressed to you the last living male relative, “Everything is not what it seems; I’m close to my
                    completing my magnun opus, but I see dangers all around me. If you are reading finish your uncle's
                    work and avoid falling prey as well.

                    your uncle had always enjoyed the company of busty, gorgeous women, but you hadn’t realized he was
                    able to keep this much of it out of the net. Now, you must find the true killer among them within 7
                    days. The clock is ticking!</p>
